# ANI-MANGO

Ani-Mango is an application that allows users to search and save their favorite anime titles for future reference. All data is sourced from the Jikan API. I'm an avid manga reader and the primary reason why I decided to build this app is because I want to delve into the world of anime. I will be constructing this app so that I can not only save anime titles I'd like to eventually watch, but also be able to see whats popular and get information about any anime with a click of a button.
