# ANI-MANGO
Ani-Mango is an application that allows users to search and save their favorite anime titles for future reference. All data is sourced from the Jikan API. The primary reason why I decided to build this app is because I enjoy reading manga/manhua as a hobby, but now I would like to delve into the world of anime. I will be constructing this app so that I can not only save anime titles I'd like to eventually watch, but also be able to see whats popular/trending and get information about any anime with a click of a button.
